## Paper Structure

Standard research paper sections:

1. **Abstract** (150-250 words): Problem, approach, findings, significance
2. **Introduction**: Motivate the problem, state contributions, outline structure
3. **Related Work**: Prior approaches, how this work differs
4. **Methods/Approach**: Technical details, algorithms, implementation
5. **Experimental Setup**: Datasets, metrics, baselines
6. **Results**: Quantitative results with figures and tables
7. **Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, limitations
8. **Conclusion**: Summary, contributions, future work
9. **References**

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

## Figure Placeholder Format

Embed inline in paper text using XML tags. ALL figures are generated by an AI image model — your description is the ONLY input it sees. It cannot read files or access data.

```xml
<figure id="fig_1">
  <title>Performance Comparison Across Models</title>
  <description>Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05.</description>
  <summary>Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline.</summary>
</figure>
```

### Data Precision Requirement

Figure descriptions MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing placeholders.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place placeholders INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

## LaTeX Compilation

### Document Setup

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx, geometry, amsmath, hyperref, natbib, booktabs, xcolor, listings}
\geometry{margin=1in}
\hypersetup{colorlinks=true, linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, urlcolor=black}
```

### Figure Inclusion

CRITICAL: Include ALL figures. Every figure MUST appear in the paper.

```latex
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth,max height=0.4\textheight]{figures/filename.png}
  \caption{Descriptive caption.}
  \label{fig:label}
\end{figure}
```

Rules:
- ALWAYS use `[!htbp]` float placement (NOT `[t]` or `[h]` alone)
- ALWAYS constrain with both `width` and `max height` to prevent page takeover
- Every figure needs `\caption`, `\label`, and a `\ref` in the text
- Do NOT convert figures to tables or describe them without inserting the image
- Do NOT skip any figures

### Compilation Process

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex
```

Fix any errors between runs. Verify `./paper.pdf` was created.

### Output Files

- `./paper.tex` — LaTeX source
- `./references.bib` — bibliography file
- `./paper.pdf` — compiled PDF
- `./figures/*.png` — all figure images

## Bibliography with DBLP

Build `./references.bib` using the dblp_bib skill (real BibTeX from DBLP):

1. For each cited paper, search DBLP: `dblp_bib_search` with author + year (e.g., "Vaswani 2017")
2. Take the `dblp_key` from search results
3. Call `dblp_bib_fetch` to get the real BibTeX entry
4. Write all entries into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from DBLP when possible
- If DBLP doesn't have a paper (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

## Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."
