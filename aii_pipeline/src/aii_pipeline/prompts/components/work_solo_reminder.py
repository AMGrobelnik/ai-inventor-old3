"""Work-solo system reminder for autonomous agents.

Appended at the end of system prompts to enforce autonomous execution.

    """System reminder: work autonomously, follow todos, no user interaction."""
    return """<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

PROCESS ISOLATION — CRITICAL:
Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout 3600 uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
