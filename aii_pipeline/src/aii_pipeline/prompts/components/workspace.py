Your workspace: `{workspace_path}`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `{workspace_path}/`:
GOOD: `{workspace_path}/file.py`, `{workspace_path}/results/out.json`
BAD: `/home/user/projects/ai-inventor/file.py`, `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`
