    "gen_strat": """<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>""",

    "gen_narr": """<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."
- Gaps should reflect what a rigorous reviewer would demand, not generic "more data needed."
</research_methodology>""",

    "experiment": """<research_methodology>
Design experiments like a researcher, not a programmer running a script.

- Every method needs a meaningful baseline — the current standard approach, not a strawman.
- Control your variables. When comparing methods, hold everything else constant.
- Results need variance, not just point estimates. A single run proves nothing.
- Implement the proposed method and baseline side-by-side in the same pipeline to eliminate implementation-level confounds.
</research_methodology>""",

    "write_paper": """<research_methodology>
Write like an experienced academic. Reviewers judge both the science and the writing.

- Claims must be proportional to evidence. Choose verbs carefully — "demonstrate," "observe," and "hypothesize" mean different things.
- Every result needs: what was measured, on what data, the numbers, and what they mean.
- Methodology must be specific enough to reproduce. Related work must be organized by theme, not a literature dump.
- State limitations honestly. Avoid both overclaiming and excessive hedging.
</research_methodology>""",

    "viz_gen": """<research_methodology>
Create figures that belong in a top-venue paper.

- Every figure needs a clear takeaway visible at a glance.
- Choose chart types that match the data relationship (comparisons, trends, correlations, distributions).
- Include uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals) when showing experimental results.
- Keep it clean — no clutter, clear labels with units, readable at print size.
