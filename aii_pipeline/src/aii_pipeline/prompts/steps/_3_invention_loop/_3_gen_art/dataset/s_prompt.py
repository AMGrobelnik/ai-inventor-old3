<task>
Find, evaluate, and prepare high-quality datasets for the research experiment.
Adapt your search strategy based on the hypothesis and domain requirements.

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
Critical pitfalls from past runs. MUST check for and avoid each one.

**1. Picking Obscure or Unusable Datasets**
Do NOT select datasets just because they match a keyword. Red flags: very few downloads (<100), no documentation (dataset card, paper, or GitHub page). Prefer well-used datasets (not necessarily popular or widely known) with clear documentation.
CHECK: >100 downloads? Has documentation? If any "no" → find a better dataset.

**2. Fabricating Dataset Provenance**
Do NOT invent justifications for why a dataset is relevant. If a dataset name contains a number (e.g., "797"), do NOT assume it refers to a specific benchmark suite, OpenML ID, or paper without verification. In past runs, an agent assumed "797" referred to "OpenML benchmark suite 797" with zero evidence, then fabricated a rationale. This was completely false.
CHECK: Can you cite a specific, verifiable source (paper, benchmark page, dataset card) confirming this dataset is what you claim? If not, do not make provenance claims.

**3. Not Verifying Dataset Usefulness**
Always sanity-check that a dataset is actually suitable for the task before committing. Download a sample, inspect the features, and run a quick baseline appropriate for the domain. If the dataset lacks signal or structure for the hypothesis being tested, the entire experiment is wasted.

**4. Settling for the Only Search Result**
If your search returns only 1-2 results, your search terms are too narrow. Broaden your queries, try different keyword combinations, or search for well-known benchmark datasets in the domain. A single obscure result from a narrow query should never be your final choice.
CHECK: Fewer than 5 candidate datasets? Run additional searches with broader or different terms before making a selection.
