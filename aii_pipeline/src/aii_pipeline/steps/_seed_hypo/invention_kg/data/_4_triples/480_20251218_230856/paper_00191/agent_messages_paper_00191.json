Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed, because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (distill &amp;amp; transfer learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we propose to share a \"distilled\" policy that captures common behaviour across tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust to hyperparameter settings and more stable - attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Overview\n\nIn machine learning and optimal control, reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize a reward signal.(no content)Reinforcement learning is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nWhile supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms respectively attempt to discover patterns in labeled and unlabeled data, reinforcement learning involves training an agent through interactions with its environment.(no content)To learn to maximize rewards from these interactions, the agent makes decisions between trying new actions to learn more about the environment (exploration), or using current knowledge of the environment to take the best action (exploitation).\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance, and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments.(no content)It has been applied successfully to various problems, including energy storage, robot control, photovoltaic generators, backgammon, checkers, Go (AlphaGo), and autonomous driving systems.\n\n## Related Areas\n\nThe search results show that reinforcement learning encompasses several specialized fields, including:\n- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which focuses on studying the behavior of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment\n- Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL), which combines reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning\n- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a technique to align an intelligent agent with human preferences by training a reward model\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
