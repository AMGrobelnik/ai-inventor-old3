For complex missions, there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs, complexity of intravehicle interactions and fleet formation with collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has received considerable attention in the last decade. This article provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination, data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Any-angle path planning approaches find shorter paths by propagating information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid edges.\n\n3. **Real-Time Path Planning**: This consists of motion planning methods that can adapt to real-time changes in the environment, including everything from primitive algorithms that stop a robot when it approaches an obstacle to more complex algorithms that continuously take in information from surroundings and create plans to avoid obstacles.\n\n4. **Sampling-Based Algorithms**: These represent the configuration space with a roadmap of sampled configurations, sampling N configurations and retaining those in free space as milestones, then constructing a roadmap that connects two milestones if the line segment between them is completely in free space.\n\n## Applications\n\nAny-angle path planning is useful for robot navigation and real-time strategy games where more optimal paths are desirable.(no content)This ability to find an optimal path also plays an important role in other fields such as video games and gene sequencing.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The validation script confirms all checks passed successfully.\n\nSources:\n- [Unmanned surface vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle)\n- [Motion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_control)\n- [Motion planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning)\n- [Collision avoidance system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_avoidance_system)\n- [Formation flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_flying)\n- [Autonomous underwater vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_underwater_vehicle)\n- [Multi-agent system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system)\n- [Mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization)\n- [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)"
