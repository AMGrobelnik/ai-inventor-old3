The focus of this book is the development of a theory of justification in the tradition of enlightenment epistemology. Its leading idea is foundation-theoretic: to reach knowledge we must not legitimize our beliefs by external authorities but justify them by rational arguments. Early foundation-theoretic epistemology was naive, since its conception of justification required certainty. Certainty was discovered to be untenable by analytic epistemologists of the 20th century, because the justification of most of our beliefs cannot be confined to deduction from evidence, but instead requires induction and abduction which cannot convey certainty but only, at most, high probability. However, the illusion of indefeasible knowledge was not only held by premodern philosophers but is also ubiquitous in commonsense intuitions of knowledge. This is revealed by an analysis of two paradoxes of knowledge: the lottery paradox and the Gettier paradox. Both paradoxes turn out to be partially unsolvable because of tensions intrinsic to commonsense intuitions associated with knowledge. It is argued that instead of trying to rationalize incoherent intuitions, epistemology should improve the commonsense concept by transforming it into the scientific concept of a justified (true) belief whose justification makes it highly probable and reveals its error probabilities.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

This question sits at the heart of epistemology, the study of knowledge.

Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either, and indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket that it will not win.

Kyburg Jr. considering a fair 1,000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket. The paradox presents a fascinating logical problem in epistemology and rational belief formation.\n\n### The Core Problem\n\nIf an event is considered \"very likely\" only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99, then it is rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either, and indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket that it will not win. However, accepting that no individual ticket will win entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.\n\n### Significance\n\nThe paradox remains of continuing interest because it raises several issues at the foundations of knowledge representation and uncertain reasoning: the relationships between fallibility, corrigible belief and logical consequence; the roles that consistency, statistical evidence and probability play in belief fixation; the precise normative force that logical and probabilistic consistency have on rational belief.\n\n### Different Approaches to Resolution\n\nKyburg's solution is to restrict aggregation.(no content)For basic probability knowledge, the first principle should be rejected: for a very likely event, the rational belief about that event is just that it is very likely, not that it is true.(no content)Most of the literature in epistemology approaches the puzzle from the orthodox point of view and grapples with the particular consequences faced by doing so, which is why the lottery is associated with discussions of skepticism and conditions for asserting knowledge claims.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."
