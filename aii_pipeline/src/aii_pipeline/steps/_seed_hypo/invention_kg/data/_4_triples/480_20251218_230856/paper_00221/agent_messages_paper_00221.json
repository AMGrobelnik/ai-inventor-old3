Unfortunately, the apparent accuracy assessed can differ greatly from the true accuracy. Mis-estimation of classification accuracy metrics and associated mis-interpretations are often due to variations in prevalence and the use of an imperfect reference standard. The fundamental issues underlying the problems associated with variations in prevalence and reference standard quality are revisited here for binary classifications with particular attention focused on the use of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). A key attribute claimed of the MCC is that a high value can only be attained when the classification performed well on both classes in a binary classification. However, it is shown here that the apparent magnitude of a set of popular accuracy metrics used in fields such as computer science medicine and environmental science (Recall, Precision, Specificity, Negative Predictive Value, J, F 1 , likelihood ratios and MCC) and one key attribute (prevalence) were all influenced greatly by variations in prevalence and use of an imperfect reference standard. Simulations using realistic values for data quality in applications such as remote sensing showed each metric varied over the range of possible prevalence and at differing levels of reference standard quality. The direction and magnitude of accuracy metric mis-estimation were a function of prevalence and the size and nature of the imperfections in the reference standard. It was evident that the apparent MCC could be substantially under- or over-estimated. Additionally, a high apparent MCC arose from an unquestionably poor classification. As with some other metrics of accuracy, the utility of the MCC may be overstated and apparent values need to be interpreted with caution. Apparent accuracy and prevalence values can be mis-leading and calls for the issues to be recognised and addressed should be heeded.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned.

Here are the key points:\n\n### Definition and Basic Concept\n\nRemote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation.(no content)The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets.\n\n### Types of Remote Sensing\n\nRemote sensing may be split into \"active\" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a sensor mounted on a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection is detected by the sensor) and \"passive\" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).\n\n**Passive Remote Sensing:** Passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors.\n\n**Active Remote Sensing:** RADAR and LiDAR are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, speed and direction of an object.\n\n### Applications\n\nRemote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the Amazon Basin, glacial features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths.

It was coined in 1975 by the eponymous biochemist, Brian Matthews.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nThe MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between −1 and +1, where a coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and −1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.\n\n## Advantages Over Other Metrics\n\nThe coefficient accounts for true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. The Matthews correlation coefficient is more informative than F1 score and accuracy in evaluating binary classification problems, because it takes into account the balance ratios of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives).\n\n## Mathematical Foundation\n\nAs a correlation coefficient, the Matthews correlation coefficient is the geometric mean of the regression coefficients of the problem and its dual. The component regression coefficients are markedness (Δp) and Youden's J statistic (informedness).\n\n## Historical Context\n\nInterestingly, the MCC is defined identically to phi coefficient, introduced by Karl Pearson, also known as the Yule phi coefficient from its introduction by Udny Yule in 1912, though the term MCC is now widely used in bioinformatics and machine learning.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
