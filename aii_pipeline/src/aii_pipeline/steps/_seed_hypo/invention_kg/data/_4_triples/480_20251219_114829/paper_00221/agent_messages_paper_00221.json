Unfortunately, the apparent accuracy assessed can differ greatly from the true accuracy. Mis-estimation of classification accuracy metrics and associated mis-interpretations are often due to variations in prevalence and the use of an imperfect reference standard. The fundamental issues underlying the problems associated with variations in prevalence and reference standard quality are revisited here for binary classifications with particular attention focused on the use of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). A key attribute claimed of the MCC is that a high value can only be attained when the classification performed well on both classes in a binary classification. However, it is shown here that the apparent magnitude of a set of popular accuracy metrics used in fields such as computer science medicine and environmental science (Recall, Precision, Specificity, Negative Predictive Value, J, F 1 , likelihood ratios and MCC) and one key attribute (prevalence) were all influenced greatly by variations in prevalence and use of an imperfect reference standard. Simulations using realistic values for data quality in applications such as remote sensing showed each metric varied over the range of possible prevalence and at differing levels of reference standard quality. The direction and magnitude of accuracy metric mis-estimation were a function of prevalence and the size and nature of the imperfections in the reference standard. It was evident that the apparent MCC could be substantially under- or over-estimated. Additionally, a high apparent MCC arose from an unquestionably poor classification. As with some other metrics of accuracy, the utility of the MCC may be overstated and apparent values need to be interpreted with caution. Apparent accuracy and prevalence values can be mis-leading and calls for the issues to be recognised and addressed should be heeded.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json.

For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned.

It is a type of supervised learning, a method of machine learning where the categories are predefined, and is used to categorize new probabilistic observations into said categories.\n\n## Common Methods\n\nLogistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nGiven a classification of a specific data set, there are four basic combinations of actual data category and assigned category: true positives TP (correct positive assignments), true negatives TN (correct negative assignments), false positives FP (incorrect positive assignments), and false negatives FN (incorrect negative assignments).(no content)The F-score is a measure of predictive performance calculated from the precision and recall of the test, where the precision is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all samples predicted to be positive, and the recall is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all samples that should have been identified as positive.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives.\n\nMore specifically:\n- Sensitivity (true positive rate) is the probability of a positive test result, conditioned on the individual truly being positive.\n- Specificity (true negative rate) is the probability of a negative test result, conditioned on the individual truly being negative.\n\n### Understanding True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives\n\nTrue positive refers to sick people correctly identified as sick; false positive refers to healthy people incorrectly identified as sick; true negative refers to healthy people correctly identified as healthy; and false negative refers to sick people incorrectly identified as healthy.\n\n### Trade-off Between Sensitivity and Specificity\n\nIf the sensitivity is high then any person who has the disease is likely to be classified as positive by the test. On the other hand, if the specificity is high, any person who does not have the disease is likely to be classified as negative by the test.\n\n### Related Metrics\n\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, and negative predictive value (NPV).(no content)In medicine sensitivity and specificity are often used, while in computer science precision and recall are preferred.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
