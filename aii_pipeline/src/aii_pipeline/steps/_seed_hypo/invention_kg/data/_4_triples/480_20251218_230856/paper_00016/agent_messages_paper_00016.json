In particular, this thesis focuses on the modularity found in the Java programming language. We begin by developing a formal semantics for a core imperative subset of Java, Middleweight Java (MJ), and then adapt separation logic to reason about this subset. However, a naive adaption of separation logic is unable to reason about encapsulation or inheritance: it provides no support for modularity. First, we address the issue of encapsulation with the novel concept of an abstract predicate, which is the logical analogue of an abstract datatype. We demonstrate how this method can encapsulate state, and provide a mechanism for ownership transfer: the ability to transfer state safely between a module and its client. We also show how abstract predicates can be used to express the calling protocol of a class. However, the encapsulation provided by abstract predicates is too restrictive for some applications. In particular, it cannot reason about multiple datatypes that have shared read-access to state, for example list iterators. To compensate, we alter the underlying model to allow the logic to express properties about read-only references to state. Additionally, we provide a model that allows both sharing and disjointness to be expressed directly in the logic. Finally, we address the second modularity issue: inheritance. We do this by extending the concept of abstract predicates to abstract predicate families. This extension allows a predicate to have multiple definitions that are indexed by class, which allows subclasses to have a different internal representation while remaining behavioural subtypes. We demonstrate the usefulness of this concept by verifying a use of the visitor design pattern.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Concrete visitors are derived from the visitor class and implement these visit methods, each of which implements part of the algorithm operating on the object structure.(no content)The element declares an accept method to accept a visitor, taking the visitor as an argument. Concrete elements, derived from the element class, implement the accept method. In its simplest form, this is no more than a call to the visitor's visit method.\n\n### Design Patterns Classification\n\nThe Visitor design pattern is one of the twenty-three Gang of Four design patterns.(no content)The visitor pattern requires a programming language that supports single dispatch, as common object-oriented languages (such as C++, Java, Smalltalk, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, Python and C#) do.\n\n### Limitations\n\nA drawback to this pattern, however, is that it makes extensions to the class hierarchy more difficult, as new classes typically require a new visit method to be added to each visitor.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Reynolds, Peter O'Hearn, Samin Ishtiaq and Hongseok Yang, drawing upon early work by Rod Burstall.\n\n### Purpose and Key Concepts\n\nSeparation logic is an extension of Hoare logic that facilitates reasoning about mutable data structures that use pointers.(no content)Separation logic supports local reasoning, whereby specifications and proofs of a program component mention only the portion of memory used by the component, and not the entire global state of the system.\n\n### Technical Foundation\n\nThe assertion language of separation logic is a special case of the logic of bunched implications (BI). In the original model, heaps are finite partial functions from locations to values, and composition is the union of heaps with disjoint domains, undefined when domains overlap. It is the undefinedness of the composition on overlapping heaps that models the separation idea.\n\n### Extensions and Applications\n\nWith Stephen Brookes, O'Hearn created Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL), extending the theory further.(no content)O'Hearn and Brookes are co-recipients of the 2016 Gödel Prize for their invention of Concurrent Separation Logic.(no content)Facebook Infer, a static analysis tool for Java, C, and Objective-C based on separation logic and bi-abduction is one prominent application. Proofs have been done using embeddings of Separation Logic into interactive theorem provers such as Rocq and HOL, which require more in the way of human effort but prove deeper properties, up to functional correctness.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
