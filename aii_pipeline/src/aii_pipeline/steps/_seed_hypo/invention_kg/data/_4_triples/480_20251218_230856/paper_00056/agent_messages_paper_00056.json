However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

In the process of swarming, a single colony splits into two or more distinct colonies.\n\n- **Birds**: Flocking is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight.\n\n- **Insects**: Midges form swarms, dancing in the air. Swarming serves multiple purposes, including the facilitation of mating by attracting females to approach the swarm.\n\n- **Plants**: Plant roots display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior.\n\n## Underlying Mechanisms\n\nStigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent.\n\n## Computational Applications\n\nThe application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Analysis Complete ✅\n\n**Paper Classification:** Survey\n\nThe paper \"Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Current Applications\" is classified as a **survey** because it collects, categorizes, and analyzes existing swarm behaviors and applications rather than proposing new methods.\n\n**Extracted Triples:** 6 entities identified\n\n1. **Swarm robotics** (concept) - The central framework surveyed in the paper\n2. **Robot** (tool) - The fundamental physical agents in swarm systems\n3. **Swarm behaviour** (concept) - The emergent behaviors from local robot interactions\n4. **Robot navigation** (task) - One of four main behavioral categories\n5. **Decision-making** (concept) - Core swarm behavior for distributed intelligence\n6. **Robotics** (concept) - The foundational interdisciplinary field\n\nAll triples are linked to Wikipedia articles with proper URLs and relevance descriptions explaining why each entity matters to the paper.\n\n**Validation:** ✅ Passed successfully\n- Paper type: survey\n- Total triples: 6\n- Entity type distribution: 4 concepts, 1 tool, 1 task\n\nSources:\n- [Swarm robotics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics)\n- [Robot - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot)\n- [Swarm behaviour - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour)\n- [Robot navigation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation)\n- [Decision-making - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making)\n- [Robotics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics)"
