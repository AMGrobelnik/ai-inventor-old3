Research in intelligent user interfaces draws on areas such as artificial and human-computer interaction to study methods for supporting varied users for a wide range of tasks, task environments, platforms, and interaction paradigms. The IUI conference is the annual meeting of the intelligent interfaces community, and serves as the principal international forum for reporting outstanding research and development in intelligent user interfaces. IUI'03, the Seventh IUI, was held at The Palms South Beach hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, USA, from January 12-15, 2003. special theme of the conference was highlighting interfaces whose focus goes beyond rational intelligence to address psychological concerns such as emotion, personality, and motivationIUI'03 solicited submissions in three categories, long papers, describing mature work; short papers, describing work in progress, and brief abstracts of system demonstrations. The conference received 134 submissions, an all-time record, including 80 long papers and 49 short papers. Based on rigorous review by an international program committee, 28 papers were selected for oral presentation, with 45 additional submissions featured as posters and demonstrations. Oral presentations spanned the areas of adaptive and collaborative interfaces, affective interfaces, agent-based interfaces, knowledge acquisition and visualization, model-based interface design, multimodal input, and natural language interfacesThe conference program highlighted three invited talks: Daniel Weld presented What Users Want, Hiroshi Ishii presented Tangible Bits: Designing the Seamless Interface between People, Bits, and Atoms, and Allen Gorin presented Semantic Information Processing of Spoken Language in 'How May I Help You?'  (sm). The panel A Life without Friction: Tales from the InfoLab, chaired by Kristian Hammond and Larry Birnbaum, gave an in-depth view of IUI research at the Information Laboratory of Northwestern University, and the panel XML: The Lingua Franca of IUIs?, chaired by Angel Puerta, examined the role of standardization of interoperation and data interchange in the IUI software industry. The conference opened with two tutorials, Intelligent User Interfaces: An Introduction, by Mark Maybury, and Recommender Systems: Interfaces and Technology, by John Riedl and Joseph Konstan\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Physical state of tangibles embodies key aspects of the digital state of a system.\n\n### TUI vs. GUI\n\nA tangible user interface must be differentiated from a graphical user interface (GUI). A GUI exists only in the digital world, whereas a TUI connects the digital with the physical world.(no content)A tangible user interface represents the input directly in the physical world, and makes the digital information directly graspable.\n\n### Key Pioneers\n\nHiroshi Ishii, a professor at the MIT who heads the Tangible Media Group at the MIT Media Lab, has a particular vision for tangible UIs, called Tangible Bits, which is to give physical form to digital information, making bits directly manipulable and perceptible.\n\n### Examples\n\nA simple example of tangible UI is the computer mouse: Dragging the mouse over a flat surface moves a pointer on the screen accordingly.(no content)Other examples include the Marble Answering Machine by Durrell Bishop (1992). A marble represents a single message left on the answering machine. Dropping a marble into a dish plays back the associated message or calls back the caller.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
