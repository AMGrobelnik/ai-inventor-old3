These Investigations appeared in 1951 in The journal of symbolic logic. They have immediately been recognised as a landmark in the history of infinitary proof theory, but their approach and method of proof have not been incorporated into the corpus of proof theory. More precisely, the admissibility of cut is proved by double induction, on the cut formula and on the complexity of the derivations, without using any ordinal assignment, contrary to the presentation of cut elimination in most standard texts on proof theory. \r\nWe propose a translation (arXiv:1710.08138) and this introduction with the intent of giving a new impetus to their reception. We also propose a translation of a preliminary manuscript, A preorder-theoretic proof of consistency, with the kind permission of Lorenzen's daughter, Jutta Reinhardt. \r\nThe Investigations are best known for providing a constructive proof of consistency for ramified type theory without axiom of reducibility. Lorenzen does so by showing that it is a part of a trivially consistent calculus that describes our knowledge of arithmetic without detour. The proof resorts only to the inductive definition of formulas and theorems. He proposes furthermore a definition of a semilattice, of a distributive lattice, of a pseudocomplemented semilattice, and of a countably complete boolean lattice as deductive calculuses, and shows how to present them for constructing the respective free object over a given preordered set. This work illustrates that lattice theory is a bridge between algebra and logic. \r\nThe preliminary manuscript, given as an appendix, contains already the main ideas and applies them to a constructive proof of consistency for elementary number theory.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Additionally, a bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative monoid.\n\n### Order-Theoretic Characterization\n\nA partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting x ≤ y whenever x ∧ y = x. For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting x ≤ y whenever x ∨ y = y.\n\n### Related Structures\n\nSemilattices include lattices, which in turn include Heyting and Boolean algebras. Semilattices also appear in various applications, such as face semilattices of hyperplane arrangements, where the face semilattice is the set of all faces ordered by inclusion, and adding an extra top element gives the face lattice.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Even more remarkably, every free lattice on three generators contains a sublattice which is free for a set of four generators. By induction, this eventually yields a sublattice free on countably many generators.\n\n## The Word Problem\n\nThe word problem for free lattices has some interesting aspects. The word problem for free bounded lattices is the problem of determining which of these elements of W(X) denote the same element in the free bounded lattice FX, and hence in every bounded lattice.(no content)One may then show that the partially ordered quotient space W(X)/~ is the free bounded lattice FX.\n\n## Complete Free Lattices\n\nThe complete free lattice (on three or more generators) \"does not exist\", in the sense that it is a proper class.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
