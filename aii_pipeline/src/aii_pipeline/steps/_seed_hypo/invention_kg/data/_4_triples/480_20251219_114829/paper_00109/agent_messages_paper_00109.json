Similar to human social groups, agents in distributed learning systems would likely benefit from communication to share knowledge and teach skills. The problem of teaching to improve agent learning has been investigated by prior works, but these approaches make assumptions that prevent application of teaching to general multiagent problems, or require domain expertise for problems they can apply to. This learning to teach problem has inherent complexities related to measuring long-term impacts of teaching that compound the standard multiagent coordination challenges. In contrast to existing works, this paper presents the first general framework and algorithm for intelligent agents to learn to teach in a multiagent environment. Our algorithm, Learning to Coordinate and Teach Reinforcement (LeCTR), addresses peer-to-peer teaching in cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning. Each agent in our approach learns both when and what to advise, then uses the received advice to improve local learning. Importantly, these roles are not fixed; these agents learn to assume the role of student and/or teacher at the appropriate moments, requesting and providing advice in order to improve teamwide performance and learning. Empirical comparisons against state-of-the-art teaching methods show that our teaching agents not only learn significantly faster, but also learn to coordinate in tasks where existing methods fail.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

It focuses on studying the behavior of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment.\n- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique to align an intelligent agent with human preferences.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

In this scenario, two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road, both have to swerve to avoid a head-on collision, and if both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide.\n\n## Coordination Failure\n\nIn economics and political science, \"Coordination Failure\" is a state of affairs in which agents' inability to coordinate their behavior (choices) leads to an outcome (equilibrium) that leaves all agents worse off than in an alternative situation that is also an equilibrium.(no content)In an economic system with multiple equilibria, coordination failure occurs when a group of firms could achieve a more desirable equilibrium but fail to because they do not coordinate their decision making.(no content)A manager can prevent coordination failure by either increasing financial incentives for employees or communicating with them, with communication being more effective than incentives.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
