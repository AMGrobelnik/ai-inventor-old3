L2 blockchains operate on the principle that computations are valid unless proven otherwise. Challenging incorrect computations requires users to construct fraud proofs through a dispute resolution process that involves two opposing players. Fraud proofs are objects that establish when proposed computations are invalid, and they are so computationally small and cheap that can be checked by the underlying trusted blockchain. Arbitration games, this challenging process, involve one player posing strategic questions and another player revealing details about computations. Arbitration games start from the posting of Disputable Assertions (DAs), DAs contain partial information about computations including their result. Since there is no trust between players, hashes are posted as compact witnesses of knowledge. One player provides information decomposing hashes while the other decides which \"path\" to take navigating the computation trace. When a path is exhausted, all the required information to compute the result from the data provided following the path has been revealed and the path can be proven to be faulty or correct. We explore in this paper the formalization of arbitration games in Lean4, introducing the first machine-checkable strategies that honest players can play guaranteeing success. These strategies ensure: on one side, the successful debunking of dishonest computations via the construction of fraud proofs, while in the other, the successful navigation of the challenge process through correct answers. In short, these are the winning strategies that honest players (on both sides) can follow. We explore in this paper formal abstractions to capture disputable assertions, arbitration games on finite binary trees asserting data-availability and membership, game transformations, and then discuss how to work towards a general formal framework for referee delegation of computations.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

I found relevant information. Based on the search results, I can now provide you with information about optimistic rollups as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n## Optimistic Rollup Layer 2\n\nLayer 2 (L2) is one of the approaches that the Ethereum ecosystem has developed in order to scale up and handle more transactions with lower transaction fees. A Layer 2 chain is a separate blockchain that extends Ethereum (Layer 1) and inherits the security guarantees of Ethereum.(no content)There are different types of L2 chains, including optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (zk rollups).(no content)Depending on their individual technical details, some L2 chains are capable of processing thousands of transactions per second.\n\nOptimistic rollups are a scaling solution designed to increase the throughput and reduce transaction costs on Ethereum while maintaining the security properties of the main blockchain.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node.\n\n## Common Types and Applications\n\n**Binary Search Trees (BST):** A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.(no content)Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items.\n\n**Binary Heaps:** A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm.\n\n## Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees\n\nA balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.(no content)A degenerate (or pathological) tree is where each parent node has only one associated child node. This means that the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.\n\n## Self-Balancing Trees\n\nA self-balancing binary search tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.(no content)There are several self-balanced binary search trees, including T-tree, treap, red-black tree, B-tree, 2–3 tree, and Splay tree.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
