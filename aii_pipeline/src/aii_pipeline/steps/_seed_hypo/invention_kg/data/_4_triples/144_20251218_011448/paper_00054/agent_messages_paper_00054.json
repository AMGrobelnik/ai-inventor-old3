However, minor differences between the simulation and the real world can cause a significant sim-to-real gap. This gap can reduce the effectiveness of the developed controller. In this paper, we examine a case study of transferring an octorotor reinforcement learning controller from simulation to the real world. First, we quantify the effectiveness of the real-world transfer by examining safety metrics. We find that although there is a noticeable (around 100%) increase in deviation in real flights, this deviation may not be considered unsafe, as it will be within > 2m safety corridors. Then, we estimate the densities of the measurement distributions and compare the Jensen-Shannon divergences of simulated and real measurements. From this, we show that the vehicle’s orientation is significantly different between simulated and real flights. We attribute this to a different flight mode in real flights where the vehicle turns to face the next waypoint. We also find that the reinforcement learning controller actions appear to correctly counteract disturbance forces. Then, we analyze the errors of a measurement autoencoder and state transition model neural network applied to real data. We find that these models further reinforce the difference between the simulated and real attitude control, showing the errors directly on the flight paths. Finally, we discuss important lessons learned in the sim-to-real transfer of our controller.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

This means the measure produces values between 0 and 1, making it interpretable as a bounded distance metric.\n\nThe value λ = 0.5 gives the Jensen–Shannon divergence, which reflects its nature as a symmetric measure that averages two directional divergences.\n\n## Applications\n\nThe Jensen–Shannon divergence has been applied in bioinformatics and genome comparison, in protein surface comparison, in the social sciences, in the quantitative study of history, in fire experiments, and in machine learning.\n\n## Extended Versions\n\nThe geometric Jensen–Shannon divergence (or G-Jensen–Shannon divergence) yields a closed-form formula for divergence between two Gaussian distributions by taking the geometric mean.\n\nAdditionally, the generalization of probability distributions on density matrices allows to define quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence (QJSD).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

It addresses the challenge of training a model on one data distribution (the source domain) and applying it to a related but different data distribution (the target domain).(no content)A common example is spam filtering, where a model trained on emails from one user (source domain) is adapted to handle emails for another user with significantly different patterns (target domain).(no content)Domain adaptation is a specific type of transfer learning. According to the taxonomy laid out by Pan and Yang (2010), it falls into the category of transductive transfer learning. In this setting, the source and target tasks are the same (e.g., both are object recognition), but the domains differ (different marginal distributions).\n\n## Key Challenges and Approaches\n\nDomain adaptation setups are classified in two different ways: according to the distribution shift between the domains, and according to the available data from the target domain. Common approaches include using adversarial machine learning and constructing shared representation spaces between domains.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
