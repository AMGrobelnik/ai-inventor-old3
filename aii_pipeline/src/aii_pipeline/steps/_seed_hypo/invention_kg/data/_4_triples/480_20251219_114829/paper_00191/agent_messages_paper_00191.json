Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed, because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (distill &amp;amp; transfer learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we propose to share a \"distilled\" policy that captures common behaviour across tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust to hyperparameter settings and more stable - attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned.
