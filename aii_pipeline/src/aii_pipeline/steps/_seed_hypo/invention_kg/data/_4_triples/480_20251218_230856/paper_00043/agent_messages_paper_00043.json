Among the various challenges faced, the safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) stands out as a critical concern. Traditional evaluation methods are both costly and inefficient, often requiring extensive driving mileage in order to encounter rare safety-critical scenarios, which are distributed on the long tail of the complex real-world driving landscape. In this paper, we propose a unified approach, Diffusion-Based Safety-Critical Scenario Generation (DiffScene), to generate high-quality safety-critical scenarios which are both realistic and safety-critical for efficient AV evaluation. In particular, we propose a diffusion-based generation framework, leveraging the power of approximating the distribution of low-density spaces for diffusion models. We design several adversarial optimization objectives to guide the diffusion generation under predefined adversarial budgets. These objectives, such as safety-based objective, functionality-based objective, and constraint-based objective, ensure the generation of safety-critical scenarios while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate the efficacy of our approach. Compared with 6 SOTA baselines, DiffScene generates scenarios that are (1) more safety-critical under 3 metrics, (2) more realistic under 5 distance functions, and (3) more transferable to different AV algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate that training AV algorithms with scenarios generated by DiffScene leads to significantly higher performance in terms of the safety-critical metrics compared to baselines. These findings highlight the potential of DiffScene in addressing the challenges of AV safety evaluation, paving the way for safer AV development.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

These scenarios are usually not written down in any detail. They can be as simple as a diagram for a testing environment or they could be a description written in prose.\n\n## Applications in System Development\n\nSince \"a system must be evaluated against the specific user tasks it is intended to support\", scenarios are ideal for evaluation.(no content)In this method only those sets of realistic, user activities that cover several components in the system are used as scenario tests.\n\n## Different Types of Scenarios\n\nThe many forms of scenario written as sequences of steps include Operational Scenarios, Concepts of Operations, and Test Cases. Additionally, Negative scenarios or misuse cases may be written to indicate likely threats which should be countered to ensure that systems have sufficient security, safety, and reliability. These help to discover non-functional requirements.\n\n## Modern Applications\n\nIn vehicular automation, Scenarios are created to represent real-world situations and are used for development, testing, and validation purposes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Additionally, safety guidelines typically prescribe a set of steps, deliverable documents, and exit criterion focused around planning, analysis and design, implementation, verification and validation, configuration management, and quality assurance activities for the development of a safety-critical system.\n\n## Testing Methods\n\nISO 13849-2 includes all of the details required for validation using analytical techniques (including FMEA, FMECA, FMEDA, IFA SISTEMA or any of the other analytical tools available), functional testing, and documentation in a validation record.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
