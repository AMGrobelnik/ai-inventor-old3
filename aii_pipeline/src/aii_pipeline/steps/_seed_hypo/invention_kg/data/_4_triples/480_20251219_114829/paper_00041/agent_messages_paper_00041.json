L2 blockchains operate on the principle that computations are valid unless proven otherwise. Challenging incorrect computations requires users to construct fraud proofs through a dispute resolution process that involves two opposing players. Fraud proofs are objects that establish when proposed computations are invalid, and they are so computationally small and cheap that can be checked by the underlying trusted blockchain. Arbitration games, this challenging process, involve one player posing strategic questions and another player revealing details about computations. Arbitration games start from the posting of Disputable Assertions (DAs), DAs contain partial information about computations including their result. Since there is no trust between players, hashes are posted as compact witnesses of knowledge. One player provides information decomposing hashes while the other decides which \"path\" to take navigating the computation trace. When a path is exhausted, all the required information to compute the result from the data provided following the path has been revealed and the path can be proven to be faulty or correct. We explore in this paper the formalization of arbitration games in Lean4, introducing the first machine-checkable strategies that honest players can play guaranteeing success. These strategies ensure: on one side, the successful debunking of dishonest computations via the construction of fraud proofs, while in the other, the successful navigation of the challenge process through correct answers. In short, these are the winning strategies that honest players (on both sides) can follow. We explore in this paper formal abstractions to capture disputable assertions, arbitration games on finite binary trees asserting data-availability and membership, game transformations, and then discuss how to work towards a general formal framework for referee delegation of computations.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Lean 4 also contains a macro system and improved type class synthesis and memory management procedures over the previous version.\n\n## Community and Impact\n\nLean has received attention from mathematicians such as Thomas Hales, Kevin Buzzard, Terence Tao, and Heather Macbeth. Buzzard uses it for the Xena project, which has the goal of rewriting every theorem and proof in the undergraduate math curriculum of Imperial College London in Lean.(no content)A community-maintained project to develop a Lean library mathlib began in 2017, with the goal to digitize as much of pure mathematics as possible in one large cohesive library, up to research level mathematics. As of May 2025, mathlib had formalized over 210,000 theorems and 100,000 definitions in Lean.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nIn 2024, Google DeepMind created AlphaProof which proves mathematical statements in Lean at the level of a silver medalist at the International Mathematical Olympiad. This was the first AI system that achieved a medal-worthy performance on a math olympiad's problems.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Wilson.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nNash's most famous contribution to game theory is the concept of the Nash equilibrium, which is a solution concept for non-cooperative games, published in 1951. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n### Branches and Applications\n\nCombinatorial game theory is a branch of mathematics and theoretical computer science that typically studies sequential games with perfect information.(no content)Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application of game theory to evolving populations in biology. It defines a framework of contests, strategies, and analytics into which Darwinian competition can be modelled.(no content)Behavioral game theory seeks to examine how people's strategic decision-making behavior is shaped by social preferences, social utility and other psychological factors.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
