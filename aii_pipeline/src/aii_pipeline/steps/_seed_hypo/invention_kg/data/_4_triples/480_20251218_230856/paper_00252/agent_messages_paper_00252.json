It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) of all ~2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List . We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non‐marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

Here's an overview of the key findings:\n\n### Definition\nBiodiversity is the variability of life on Earth.(no content)It can be measured on various levels, for example, genetic variability, species diversity, ecosystem diversity and phylogenetic diversity.\n\n### Global Biodiversity\nAccording to estimates, there are approximately 8.7 million terrestrial species and 2.2 million oceanic species. However, about 1.74 million species were databased as of 2018, and over 80 percent have not yet been described.\n\n### Current Crisis\nThere is a significant biodiversity crisis underway. The planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the World Wildlife Fund.(no content)The rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates.\n\n### Major Threats\nThe cause of most of the biodiversity loss is generally human activities that push the planetary boundaries too far, including habitat destruction (for example deforestation) and land use intensification (for example monoculture farming).(no content)Climate change is another threat to global biodiversity, though habitat destruction is currently the bigger driver of biodiversity loss.\n\n### Biodiversity Hotspots\nA biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human habitation.(no content)These sites support nearly 60% of the world's plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species on just 2.4% of the planet's surface.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Raup identified five particular geological intervals with excessive diversity loss. These are:\n\n1. **Late Ordovician**: Occurring roughly 445 million years ago, it eliminated 49–60% of marine genera and nearly 85% of marine species.\n\n2. **Late Devonian**: Around 372 million years ago, likely around 40% of marine species went extinct.\n\n3. **Permian-Triassic (The Great Dying)**: This extinction event occurred approximately 251.9 million years ago, with the extinction of 57% of biological families, 62% of genera, 81% of marine species, and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species—making it Earth's most severe known extinction event.\n\n4. **Triassic-Jurassic**: This marks the Triassic–Jurassic transition, with about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera, and 70% to 75% of all species becoming extinct.\n\n5. **Cretaceous-Paleogene**: This event is not detailed in these results but is part of the \"Big Five.\"\n\n### Current Mass Extinction\n\nA sixth mass extinction event caused by anthropogenic activity is currently under way, and numerous experts believe we are living through a mass species extinction event that is the first to be caused by a single organism—humans.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
