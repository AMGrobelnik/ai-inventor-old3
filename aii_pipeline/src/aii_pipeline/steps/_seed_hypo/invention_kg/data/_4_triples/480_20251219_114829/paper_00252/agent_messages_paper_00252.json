It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) of all ~2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List . We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non‐marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

For example, many endemic species are found on remote islands, such as Hawaii, the Galápagos Islands and Socotra.(no content)Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of island biogeography was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland.\n\n## Island Examples\n\n50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands. Some striking examples include:\n\n- **Hawaii**: Located nearly 2,400 miles from the nearest continental shore, the Hawaiian Islands are the most isolated group of islands on the planet. The plant and animal life of the Hawaiian archipelago is the result of early, very infrequent colonizations of arriving species and the slow evolution of those species—in isolation from the rest of the world's flora and fauna—over a period of at least 5 million years. As a consequence, Hawai'i is home to a large number of endemic species.\n\n- **New Zealand**: 71% of New Zealand's bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic.\n\n## Conservation Significance\n\nEndemism is an important concept in conservation biology for measuring biodiversity in a particular place and evaluating the risk of extinction for species. However, the movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, habitat destruction, or introduced species.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

For example, many endemic species are found on remote islands, such as Hawaii, the Galápagos Islands and Socotra.(no content)Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of island biogeography was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland.\n\n## Island Examples\n\n50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands. Some striking examples include:\n\n- **Hawaii**: Located nearly 2,400 miles from the nearest continental shore, the Hawaiian Islands are the most isolated group of islands on the planet. The plant and animal life of the Hawaiian archipelago is the result of early, very infrequent colonizations of arriving species and the slow evolution of those species—in isolation from the rest of the world's flora and fauna—over a period of at least 5 million years. As a consequence, Hawai'i is home to a large number of endemic species.\n\n- **New Zealand**: 71% of New Zealand's bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic.\n\n## Conservation Significance\n\nEndemism is an important concept in conservation biology for measuring biodiversity in a particular place and evaluating the risk of extinction for species. However, the movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, habitat destruction, or introduced species.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

      "result": "Excellent! I've successfully completed the analysis of \"The Sixth Mass Extinction\" paper. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Analysis Complete ✅\n\n**Paper Classification:** Survey (position paper reviewing existing evidence about extinctions)\n\n**10 Triples Extracted:**\n\n1. **Extinction event** - The foundational concept of mass extinctions discussed throughout\n2. **Biodiversity** - Core subject of biodiversity loss and crisis\n3. **IUCN Red List** - Data source critically examined for its biases\n4. **Background extinction rate** - The baseline metric for comparing current extinction rates\n5. **Mollusca** - Used as primary example for extrapolating global extinction estimates\n6. **Conservation biology** - Field discussed for inadequate response to invertebrate extinction\n7. **Natural history** - Advocated for revival in specimen collection and documentation\n8. **Taxonomy** - Called for renewed emphasis on taxonomic study\n9. **Endemism** - Island species examined for disproportionately high extinction rates\n10. **Marine invertebrates** - Examined for crisis severity compared to non-marine species\n\nAll triples have been properly validated with correct Wikipedia URLs, entity types, relations (uses/proposes), and relevance statements. The validation script confirmed all checks passed successfully.\n\nSources:\n- [Extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event)\n- [Biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity)\n- [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List)\n- [Background extinction rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_extinction_rate)\n- [Mollusca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca)\n- [Conservation biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology)\n- [Natural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history)\n- [Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy)\n- [Endemism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism)\n- [Marine invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_invertebrates)"
