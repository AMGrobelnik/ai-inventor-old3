This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of knowledge discovery, data science, and machine learning. The mission of the conference is to provide the premier forum for advancement, education, and adoption of the \"science\" of knowledge discovery and machine learning from all types of data; to share novel methodologies that fulfill the needs of heterogeneous applications and environments and identify new directions for future research and development. These ideas have the potential to shape and impact our society and environment, and are becoming particularly important with the emergence of AI in all fields. KDD provides researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in various aspects of data science and machine learning. KDD '23 has a program of three keynotes, 313 research track papers, 184 ADS (Applied Data Science) track papers, 34 workshops, 33 tutorials, nine special days, three panels, and eight ADS invited talks. For the first time, we switched to OpenReview with the mission to further improve the review quality and facilitate the interaction between reviewers and authors. We have introduced several new special days, such as Large Language Model (LLM) Day, Finance Day, AI for Open Society Day, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (ESM) Day, Southern California Data Science; and several new panels, such as AI for Science and LLMs for education & research. The rise of LLMs has been historic and the nature of creativity itself may change. With this in mind, we have emphasized LLMs in our keynotes, special days, and panels. Only time will tell whether we went too far or not far enough!\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n## Overview\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nMachine learning is commonly separated into three main learning paradigms, supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.(no content)ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.\n\n## History\n\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.(no content)The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side.\n\n## Neural Networks\n\nIn machine learning, a neural network or neural net (NN), also called artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks. A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain.\n\nThe search results provide comprehensive information about machine learning fundamentals, historical development, and modern applications.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

This process is related to a concept of reverse engineering, and usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary.\n\n## Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM)\n\nKnowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) is a publicly available specification from the Object Management Group (OMG). KDM is a common intermediate representation for existing software systems and their operating environments, that defines common metadata required for deep semantic integration of Application Lifecycle Management tools.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

These include applications in architecture, media analysis, video surveillance, music composition, and more.\n\n## Recent Concerns\n\nPower demand for AI and cryptocurrency uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.
