The online SIGMOD conference is complemented with a local physical event at Xi'an, primarily targeting the data management community in China. Despite the challenging times that we find ourselves in, we have an exciting technical program with outstanding research, industrial and demonstration track presentations, keynotes, tutorials, panels, and the awards session. For the first time, SIGMOD is being held round the clock, with each technical talk presented twice 12 hours apart, to better accommodate online participants from around the world, Also, for the first time, presentations are being grouped into curated sessions to give participants a cohesive, single track experience on a variety of leading edge topics in data management. We are using the latest technologies to keep SIGMOD vibrant, and we will be archiving most SIGMOD presentations, for those who want to review them at a later date. This year, with the approval of the SIGMOD EC, we introduced two new categories of papers in the Research Track, (a) Data Science & Engineering and (b) Applications, to complement the traditional Data Management category. Data Science & Engineering papers focused on dataintensive components of data science pipelines, solving problems in areas of interest to the community inspired by real applications. Applications papers presented novel applications of data management systems and technologies to inspire future research in the community. In the Research Track this year, we received 450 research submissions (172 for Round 1 and 278 for Round 2), which were extensively reviewed by 175 program committee members, 23 associate editors, and several external reviewers. We accepted 188 submissions (a 41.8% acceptance rate), most of them after a revision phase that gave authors 10+ weeks to revise and resubmit their papers in response to the reviewer comments. This year we introduced a new set of detailed reviewing instructions focused on reviewing constructively as well as redesigned the review forms to promote constructive reviewing. In addition, we introduced a new step in the reviewing process, the Review Quality week where the associate editors check reviews for certain quality criteria and probe reviewers for constructive rewrites before reviews are released to the authors. In addition, the authors were able to provide structured feedback directly to the associate editors and the program chairs about review quality. Overall, more than 300 reviews were updated for quality during this process leading to a higher number of revision requests. In addition to the Research Track, the Industrial Track selected 21 papers from 54 submissions; the Demonstration Track selected 27 demonstrations from 75 submissions; the Tutorial Track selected 8 tutorials from 20 submissions and the Student Research Competition selected all 18 submissions for the second round of competition. This year, we will have two exciting keynote talks, reflecting emerging topics of great interest to the data management community: \"Utilizing (and Designing) Modern Hardware for Data- Intensive Computations: The Role of Abstraction\" by Kenneth A. Ross (Columbia University) and \"Deep Data Integration\" by Wang-Chiew Tan (Facebook AI). iv In addition, we will have two timely and interesting panels: \"Data Management to Social Science and Back in the Future of Work\" organized by Sihem Amer-Yahia (CNRS) and Senjuti Basu Roy (New Jersey Institute of Technology), and \"Automation of Data Prep, ML, and Data Science: New Cure or Snake Oil?\" organized by Arun Kumar (University of California, San Diego).\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain.\n\nThe search results show that machine learning has evolved significantly from its origins in the 1950s to become a fundamental technology driving advances in artificial intelligence today.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
