Active, hardware-mediated solutions are often infeasible or prohibitively costly to build and run across arbitrary collections of input systems. The Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) framework offers a software-based approach to synchronizing data streams based on per-sample time stamps and time synchronization across a common local area netowrk (LAN). Built from the ground up for neurophysiological applications and designed for reliability, LSL offers zero-configuration functionality and accounts for network delays and jitters, making connection recovery, offset correction, and jitter compensation possible. These features can ensure continuous, millisecond-precise data recording, even in the face of interruptions. In this paper, we present an overview of LSL architecture, core features, and performance in common experimental contexts. We also highlight practical considerations and known pitfalls when using LSL, including the need to take into account input device throughput delays that LSL cannot itself measure or correct. The LSL ecosystem has grown to support over 150 data acquisition device classes and to establish interoperability between client software written in several programming languages including C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, C#, JavaScript, Rust, and Julia. The resilience and versatility of LSL have made it a major data synchronization platform for multimodal human neurobehavioral recording, now supported by a wide range of software packages including major stimulus presentation tools, real-time analysis envirnoments, and brain-computer interface applications. Beyond basic science, research, and development, LSL has been used as a resilient and transparent back-end in deployment scenarios including interactive art installations, stage performances, and commercial products. In neurobehavioral studies and other neuroscience applications, LSL facilitates the complex task of capturing organismal dynamics and environmental changes occurring within and across multiple data streams on a common timeline.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples.

Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

This monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive means such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), or by more invasive means such as electrophysiology, the use of electrodes to record the electrical activity of single neurons or groups of neurons.\n\n## Stimulus Modality\n\nStimulus modality, also called sensory modality, is one aspect of a stimulus or what is perceived after a stimulus. Some sensory modalities include: light, sound, temperature, taste, pressure, and smell.\n\nThe search results also cover related topics like neural adaptation, neural coding, and how neurons encode stimulus information through firing rates and temporal patterns.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
