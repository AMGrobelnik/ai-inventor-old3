Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES.

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Analysis Summary\n\n**Paper Classification**: **Contribution** - This paper proposes a novel causal mechanism explaining how digital media drive affective polarization through partisan sorting, replacing the dominant echo chamber hypothesis.\n\n**Key Triples Extracted** (6 total):\n\n1. **Political polarization** (concept, uses) - The core phenomenon the paper addresses\n2. **Affective polarization** (concept, uses) - The specific type of polarization (emotional dislike) the paper focuses on\n3. **Partisan sorting** (concept, proposes) - The novel mechanism the paper proposes as the driver of polarization\n4. **Echo chamber (media)** (concept, uses) - The existing hypothesis the paper challenges and builds upon\n5. **Digital media** (tool, uses) - The platforms enabling nonlocal interactions that drive partisan alignment\n6. **Opinion dynamics** (concept, uses) - The theoretical framework for modeling opinion evolution\n\n**Validation Result**: ✅ **PASSED** - All 6 triples are properly formatted with valid Wikipedia URLs, correct entity types, and appropriate relations (5 \"uses\", 1 \"proposes\").\n\nSources:\n- [Political polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization)\n- [Partisan sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_sorting)\n- [Echo chamber (media)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media))\n- [Digital media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media)\n- [Mathematical models of social learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_models_of_social_learning)"
