Mathematical minds get hooked up in simple models for evolution and often gradually move into other parts of evolutionary biology or ecology. Social scientists realize how much they can learn from evolutionary thinking and gradually transfer insight that was originally generated in biology. Computer scientists can use their algorithms to explore a new field where machines not only learn from the environment, but also from each other. The breadth of the field and the focus on a few very popular issues, such as cooperation, comes at a price: several insights are re-discovered in different fields under different labels with different heroes and modelling traditions. For example, reciprocity or spatial structure are treated differently. Will we continue to develop things in parallel? Or can we converge to a single set of ideas, a single tradition and eventually a single software repository? Or will these fields continue to cross-fertilize each other, learning from each other and engaging in a constructive exchange between fields? Ultimately, the popularity of evolutionary game theory rests not only on its explanatory power, but also on the intuitive character of its models. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Half a century of evolutionary games: a synthesis of theory, application and future directions’.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",
