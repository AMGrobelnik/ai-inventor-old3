Despite the assumed benefits of utilizing chatbots in language classrooms, such as providing interactional chances or helping to create an anxiety-free atmosphere, little is known about learners' actual use of chatbots during language classes or how chatbots affect their motivation to learn a language. To address these gaps, this exploratory study aimed to create an inventory of affordances that chatbots provide in the primary English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom and to explore how the affordances affect psychological aspects in language learners, particularly regarding their motivation to learn English through chatbots. Thirty-six Korean primary school learners participated in a 16-week EFL course that utilized customized chatbots. These chatbots were created using Google's Dialogflow. After the course, individual in-depth interviews were conducted regarding the participants' experiences and perceptions of the chatbots. Student-chatbot interaction logs produced during the course were also collected to supplement the interview data. Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts and interaction logs revealed the presence of pedagogical, technological, and social affordances. Depending on the learner, the chatbot affordances were perceived differently; thus, each affordance acted as either an opportunity or a constraint for English language learning. In addition, this study specifically discussed how these chatbot affordances might have affected psychological states in language learners. Future recommendations regarding the use of chatbots in language classrooms were suggested from both pedagogical and technological perspectives.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

More specifically, affordances \"suggest\" how an object may be interacted with.\n\n### Historical Background\n\nThe term was coined by American psychologist James J. Gibson in his 1966 book, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems. However, in 1988, Donald Norman appropriated the term affordances in the context of Human–Computer Interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor.(no content)Through Norman's book The Design of Everyday Things, this interpretation was popularized within the fields of HCI, interaction design, and user-centered design.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nNorman's definition makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. A practical example: doors that can be pushed or pulled are examples of affordances, which are the possible interactions between an object and its user, with corresponding signifiers being flat plates on doors meant to be pushed, small finger-size push-buttons, and long and rounded bars used as handles.\n\n### Signifiers vs. Affordances\n\nNorman later explained that his restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and in his 2013 update of The Design of Everyday Things, he added the concept \"signifiers\".(no content)Affordances determine what actions are possible, while signifiers communicate where the action should take place.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
