Now that social networks and mobile internet are prominent features in daily life, more experts are able to take participate in decision making in the network and their opinions are influenced by others in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to use the difference of opinions and the relationships between experts to promote the consensus is an important issue. This paper proposed a CRP approach for large-scale group decision-making based on bounded confidence and social network to manage experts’ opinions. Firstly, a fast unfolding algorithm was used to reduce the dimension of the large-scale and the experts’ weights were obtained by social network analysis. Secondly, the CRP was built based on the Manhattan distance, and the feedback mechanism was developed to adjust experts’ opinions based on bounded confidence and social network when the experts did not reach a consensus. A numerical example was used to show the feasibility of the proposed approach and the results illustrated that the consensus speed was faster and the information managed more efficiently. The comparisons with other approaches showed the advantage of our proposed approach. Finally, simulation experiments were given to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n</paper>\n\n<paper_classification>\n\"contribution\" = proposes something new (method, technique, dataset, framework, benchmark, etc.)\n\"survey\" = literature review, overview, meta-analysis, position papers (only references existing work)\n</paper_classification>\n\n<entity_types>\ntask      - Problem being solved (image classification, theorem proving, protein folding)\nmethod    - Technique, algorithm, procedure (gradient descent, CRISPR, induction)\ndata      - Datasets, databases, benchmarks (ImageNet, MNIST, arXiv corpus)\nartifact  - Pre-built: trained models, proof libraries (GPT-4, Mathlib, Cas9)\ntool      - Software, instruments, platforms (PyTorch, Lean prover, microscope)\nconcept   - Abstract ideas, theories, frameworks (attention, category theory)\nother     - Entities that don't fit above categories\n</entity_types>\n\n<relations>\nuses     - Anything EXISTING that the paper uses (methods, datasets, tools, concepts, tasks)\nproposes - Anything NEW/NOVEL that the paper creates or introduces\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- ALL papers MUST have at least 1 \"uses\" (papers always build on existing work)\n- CONTRIBUTION papers MUST have at least 1 \"proposes\" (they must create something new)\n</relations>\n\n<output_json>\n{\n  \"paper_type\": \"contribution\" or \"survey\",\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wikipedia Article Title\",\n      \"relation\": \"uses|proposes\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"task|method|data|artifact|tool|concept|other\",\n      \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...\",\n      \"relevance\": \"Why this matters (1 sentence)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_json>\n\n<YOUR_TODO_LIST>\nFIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with \"TodoWrite\" tool:\n\nCRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.\n\n1. Read ./triples_output.json. Classify paper as \"contribution\" or \"survey\". Edit triples_output.json to set paper_type field.\n\n2. List ALL triples EXPLICITLY mentioned in title/abstract. For each, determine entity_type and relation.\n\n3. For each triple: Use WebSearch tool with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] to search \"[entity name]\" to find the correct Wikipedia article. IMPORTANT: Always include allowed_domains parameter to restrict to English Wikipedia.\n\n4. Edit triples_output.json to add all triples. For each triple:\n   - name: Use the Wikipedia article title (e.g., \"Gradient descent\" not \"gradient descent algorithm\")\n   - relation: how paper relates to entity (uses or proposes)\n   - entity_type: one of task, method, data, artifact, tool, concept, other\n   - wikipedia_url: The Wikipedia URL from search results (must start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)\n   - relevance: 1 sentence explaining why it matters\n\n5. Run validation: python validate_triple_json.py\n\n6. If validation errors: Fix the errors (use WebSearch with allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"] again if needed for incorrect URLs), edit triples_output.json, and rerun validation. MUST REPEAT until validation passes.\n\n<CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\nWhen using WebSearch, you MUST use the allowed_domains parameter:\nWebSearch(query=\"[your query]\", allowed_domains=[\"en.wikipedia.org\"])\n\nThis ensures only English Wikipedia results are returned. Do NOT search without allowed_domains.\n</CRITICAL_WEBSEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS>\n</YOUR_TODO_LIST>\n\nBegin now.",

In a grid plan, the travel distance between street corners is given by the Manhattan distance: the number of east–west and north–south blocks one must traverse to get between those two points.\n\nThe taxicab distance is also sometimes known as rectilinear distance or L1 distance.\n\n### Applications\n\nManhattan distance is commonly used in GPS applications, as it can be used to find the shortest route between two addresses. Additionally, Manhattan distance is particularly useful for clustering data that is arranged in a grid or lattice structure, such as image or signal processing data.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

However, they also present liabilities such as requiring more time to make choices and by consequence rushing to a low-quality agreement in order to be timely.(no content)In workplace settings, collaborative decision-making is one of the most successful models to generate buy-in from other stakeholders, build consensus, and encourage creativity. Decisions made collectively also tend to be more effective than decisions made by a single individual.\n\n## Key Challenges\n\nGroup polarization can occur, leading some groups to make more extreme decisions than those of its individual members. Additionally, there is a tendency to exhibit a bias towards discussing shared information, as opposed to unshared information.\n\n## Common Decision-Making Methods\n\nSocial decision schemes are the methods used by a group to combine individual responses to come up with a single group decision. An individual, subgroup or external party makes the decision on behalf of the group, such as in an authority scheme where the leader makes the decision.(no content)Each group member can make their own private and independent decision and all are later \"averaged\" to produce a decision, or group members vote on their preferences, either privately or publicly.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
