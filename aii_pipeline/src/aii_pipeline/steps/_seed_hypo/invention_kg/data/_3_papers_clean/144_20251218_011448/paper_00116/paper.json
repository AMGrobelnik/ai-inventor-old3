  "abstract": "Chapter 6 empirically tests whether and how participatory technologies influence political attitudes. Using two original survey experiments and qualitative data from interviews and focus groups, this chapter examines the impact of awareness of the Direct Line on approval of President Putin and perceptions of voice. The results indicate that participatory technologies have a positive impact on attitudes toward authorities. It also argues that, while government responsiveness to citizen demands does improve attitudes toward autocrats, the mere presence of participation opportunities bolsters support regardless of authorities' response to these demands.",
