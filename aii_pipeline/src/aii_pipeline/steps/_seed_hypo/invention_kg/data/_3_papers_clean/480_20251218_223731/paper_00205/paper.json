  "title": "Visualizations with statistical details: The 'ggstatsplot' approach",
  "abstract": "Graphical displays can reveal problems in a statistical model that might not be apparent from purely numerical summaries.Such visualizations can also be helpful for the reader to evaluate the validity of a model if it is reported in a scholarly publication or report.But, given the onerous costs involved, researchers often avoid preparing information-rich graphics and exploring several statistical approaches or tests available.The ggstatsplot package in the R programming language (R Core Team, 2021) provides a one-line syntax to enrich ggplot2based visualizations with the results from statistical analysis embedded in the visualization itself.In doing so, the package helps researchers adopt a rigorous, reliable, and robust data exploratory and reporting workflow.",
