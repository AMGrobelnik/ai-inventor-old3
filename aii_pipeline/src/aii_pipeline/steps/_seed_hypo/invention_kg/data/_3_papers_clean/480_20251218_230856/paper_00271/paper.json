  "title": "Shaping of microbial phenotypes by trade-offs",
  "abstract": "Abstract Growth rate maximization is an important fitness strategy for microbes. However, the wide distribution of slow-growing oligotrophic microbes in ecosystems suggests that rapid growth is often not favored across ecological environments. In many circumstances, there exist trade-offs between growth and other important traits (e.g., adaptability and survival) due to physiological and proteome constraints. Investments on alternative traits could compromise growth rate and microbes need to adopt bet-hedging strategies to improve fitness in fluctuating environments. Here we review the mechanistic role of trade-offs in controlling bacterial growth and further highlight its ecological implications in driving the emergences of many important ecological phenomena such as co-existence, population heterogeneity and oligotrophic/copiotrophic lifestyles.",
