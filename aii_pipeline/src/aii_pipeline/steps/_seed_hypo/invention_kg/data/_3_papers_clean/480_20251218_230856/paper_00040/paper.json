  "title": "Improving the SMT Proof Reconstruction Pipeline in Isabelle/HOL",
  "abstract": "Sledgehammer is a tool that increases the level of automation in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant by asking external automatic theorem provers (ATPs), including SMT solvers, to prove the current goal. When the external ATP succeeds it must provide enough evidence that the goal holds for Isabelle to be able to reprove it internally based on that evidence. In particular, Isabelle can do this by replaying fine-grained proof certificates from proof-producing SMT solvers as long as they are expressed in the Alethe format, which until now was supported only by the veriT SMT solver. We report on our experience adding proof reconstruction support for the cvc5 SMT solver in Isabelle by extending cvc5 to produce proofs in the Alethe format and then adapting Isabelle to reconstruct those proofs. We discuss several difficulties and pitfalls we encountered and describe a set of tools and techniques we developed to improve the process. A notable outcome of this effort is that Isabelle can now be used as an independent proof checker for SMT problems written in the SMT-LIB standard. We evaluate cvc5’s integration on a set of SMT-LIB benchmarks originating from Isabelle as well as on a set of Isabelle proofs. Our results confirm that this integration complements and improves Sledgehammer’s capabilities.",
