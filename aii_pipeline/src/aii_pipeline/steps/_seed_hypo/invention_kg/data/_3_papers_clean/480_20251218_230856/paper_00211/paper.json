  "title": "Interval Dominance-Based Feature Selection for Interval-Valued Ordered Data",
  "abstract": "Dominance-based rough approximation discovers inconsistencies from ordered criteria and satisfies the requirement of the dominance principle between single-valued domains of condition attributes and decision classes. When the ordered decision system (ODS) is no longer single-valued, how to utilize the dominance principle to deal with multivalued ordered data is a promising research direction, and it is the most challenging step to design a feature selection algorithm in interval-valued ODS (IV-ODS). In this article, we first present novel thresholds of interval dominance degree (IDD) and interval overlap degree (IOD) between interval values to make the dominance principle applicable to an IV-ODS, and then, the interval-valued dominance relation in the IV-ODS is constructed by utilizing the above two developed parameters. Based on the proposed interval-valued dominance relation, the interval-valued dominance-based rough set approach (IV-DRSA) and their corresponding properties are investigated. Moreover, the interval dominance-based feature selection rules based on IV-DRSA are provided, and the relevant algorithms for deriving the interval-valued dominance relation and the feature selection methods are established in IV-ODS. To illustrate the effectiveness of the parameters variation on feature selection rules, experimental evaluation is performed using 12 datasets coming from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository.",
