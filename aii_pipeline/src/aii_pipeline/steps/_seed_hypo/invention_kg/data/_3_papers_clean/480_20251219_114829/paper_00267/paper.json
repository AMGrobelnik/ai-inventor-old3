  "title": "Network Complexity and Stability of Microbes Enhanced by Microplastic Diversity",
  "abstract": "Microplastic mixtures are ubiquitously distributed in global ecosystems and include varying types. However, it remains unknown how microplastic diversity affects the biotic interactions of microbes. Here, we developed novel experiments of 600 microcosms with microplastic diversity ranging from 1 to 6 types and examined ecological networks for microbial communities in lake sediments after 2 months of incubation at 15 and 20 °C. We found that microplastic diversity generally enhanced the complexity of microbial networks at both temperatures, such as increasing network connectance and reducing average path length. This phenomenon was further confirmed by strengthened species interactions toward high microplastic diversity except for the negative interactions at 15 °C. Interestingly, increasing temperatures further exaggerated the effects of microplastic diversity on network structures, resulting in higher network connectivity and species interactions. Consistently, using species extinction simulations, we found that higher microplastic diversity and temperature led to more robust networks, and their effects were additionally and positively mediated by the presence of biodegradable microplastics. Our findings provide the first evidence that increasing microplastic diversity could unexpectedly promote the complexity and stability of microbial networks and that future warming could amplify this effect.",
