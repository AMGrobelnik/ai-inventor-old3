  "abstract": "We are delighted to welcome you to the 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM) 2022. While originally scheduled to be held in Tempe, Arizona, the conference had to move in late December 2021 to a virtual format. This difficult decision was made in light of the surge in Omicron cases, enhanced travel restrictions from various parts of the world, and companies scrapping office-return deadlines without setting a new date. WSDM (pronounced \"wisdom\") is one of the premier conferences on web-inspired research involving search and data mining. WSDM publishes original, high-quality papers related to search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web, with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance. This year's conference hosts an exciting technical program, including invited talks, as well as refereed full papers. The conference hosts an exciting technical program, including 7 workshops, 7 tutorials, 9 doctoral consortium presentations, 14 technical demos, 160 research papers, industry day presentations, smart city day presentations, and 3 exciting keynote talks on timely topics:Yejin Choi (University of Washington) - Knowledge is Power: Symbolic Knowledge Distillation, Commonsense Morality, and Multimodal Script KnowledgeGeorge Karypis (Amazon, University of Minnesota) - Graph Neural Network Research at AWS AIRicardo Baeza-Yates (Northeastern University) - Ethics Challenges in AI",
