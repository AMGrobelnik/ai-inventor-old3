  "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD 2023. This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of knowledge discovery, data science, and machine learning. The mission of the conference is to provide the premier forum for advancement, education, and adoption of the \"science\" of knowledge discovery and machine learning from all types of data; to share novel methodologies that fulfill the needs of heterogeneous applications and environments and identify new directions for future research and development. These ideas have the potential to shape and impact our society and environment, and are becoming particularly important with the emergence of AI in all fields. KDD provides researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in various aspects of data science and machine learning. KDD '23 has a program of three keynotes, 313 research track papers, 184 ADS (Applied Data Science) track papers, 34 workshops, 33 tutorials, nine special days, three panels, and eight ADS invited talks. For the first time, we switched to OpenReview with the mission to further improve the review quality and facilitate the interaction between reviewers and authors. We have introduced several new special days, such as Large Language Model (LLM) Day, Finance Day, AI for Open Society Day, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (ESM) Day, Southern California Data Science; and several new panels, such as AI for Science and LLMs for education & research. The rise of LLMs has been historic and the nature of creativity itself may change. With this in mind, we have emphasized LLMs in our keynotes, special days, and panels. Only time will tell whether we went too far or not far enough!",
