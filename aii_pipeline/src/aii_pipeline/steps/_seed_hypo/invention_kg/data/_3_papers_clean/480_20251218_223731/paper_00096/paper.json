  "title": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs): Current State, Emerging Technologies, and Future Trends",
  "abstract": "Unmanned aircraft, commonly referred to as drones, represent a valuable alternative for various operational tasks due to their versatility, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and reusability. These features make them particularly advantageous in environments that are hazardous or inaccessible to humans. Recent developments have highlighted a significant increase in the use of unmanned aircraft within metropolitan areas. This growth has necessitated the implementation of new regulations and guidelines to ensure the safe integration of UAS into urban environments. Consequently, the concept of UAM has emerged. UAM refers to an innovative air transportation paradigm designed for both passengers and cargo within urban settings, leveraging the capabilities of drones. This review manuscript explores the latest advancements for UAS, focusing on updated regulations, definitions, enabling technologies, and airspace classifications relevant to UAM operations. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive overview of unmanned aircraft systems, including their classifications, key features, and primary applications.",
