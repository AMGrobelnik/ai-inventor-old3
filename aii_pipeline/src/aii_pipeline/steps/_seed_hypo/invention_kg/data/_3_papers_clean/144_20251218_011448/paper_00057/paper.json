  "title": "Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the reward function underlying a Markov Decision Process given the dynamics of the system and the behaviour of an expert. IRL is motivated by situations where knowledge of the rewards is a goal by itself (as in preference elicitation) and by the task of apprenticeship learning (learning policies from an expert). In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions. Experimental results show strong improvement for our methods over previous heuristic-based approaches.",
