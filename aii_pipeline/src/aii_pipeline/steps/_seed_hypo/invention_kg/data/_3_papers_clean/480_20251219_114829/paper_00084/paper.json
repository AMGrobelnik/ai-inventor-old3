  "title": "A Distributed Competitive and Collaborative Coordination for Multirobot Systems",
  "abstract": "Enlightened by competitive and collaborative coordination behaviors widely observed in natural swarm systems, this work emphasizes these coordinating modes in multirobot systems and optimizes system stability along with resource utilization. Then, schemes are constructed to describe and model these two modes, where a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> -winner-take-all concept is introduced as the driving principle of multirobot competition. In addition, a distributed coordination approach is established to effectively handle the above schemes aided with optimality theory, which is developed by a fusion of a recurrent neural dynamics solver and a distributed solver. The former is a single-layer neural dynamics model with a simple structure, and the latter transforms the involved global information to a distributed type via consensus. Both of them are carried out in the discrete-time domain to fit the actual application. Finally, the convergence and stability of the proposed coordination approach are proved via theoretical analysis and further demonstrated through simulations and experiments.",
