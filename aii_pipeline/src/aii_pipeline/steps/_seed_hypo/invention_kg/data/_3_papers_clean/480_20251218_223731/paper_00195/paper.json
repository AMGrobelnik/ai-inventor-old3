  "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotics: A Survey of Real-World Successes",
  "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly its combination with deep neural networks referred to as deep RL (DRL), has shown tremendous promise across a wide range of applications, suggesting its potential for enabling the development of sophisticated robotic behaviors. Robotics problems, however, pose fundamental difficulties for the application of RL, stemming from the complexity and cost of interacting with the physical world. These challenges notwithstanding, recent advances have enabled DRL to succeed at some real-world robotic tasks. However, state-of-the-art DRL solutions’ maturity varies significantly across robotic applications. In this talk, I will review the current progress of DRL in real-world robotic applications based on our recent survey paper (with Tang, Abbatematteo, Hu, Chandra, and Martı́n-Martı́n), with a particular focus on evaluating the real-world successes achieved with DRL in realizing several key robotic competencies, including locomotion, navigation, stationary manipulation, mobile manipulation, human-robot interaction, and multi-robot interaction. The analysis aims to identify the key factors underlying those exciting successes, reveal underexplored areas, and provide an overall characterization of the status of DRL in robotics. I will also highlight several important avenues for future work, emphasizing the need for stable and sample-efficient real-world RL paradigms, holistic approaches for discovering and integrating various competencies to tackle complex long-horizon, open-world tasks, and principled development and evaluation procedures. The talk is designed to offer insights for RL practitioners and roboticists toward harnessing RL’s power to create generally capable real-world robotic systems.",
