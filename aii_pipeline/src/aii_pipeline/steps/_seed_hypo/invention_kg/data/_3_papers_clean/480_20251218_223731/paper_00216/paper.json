  "title": "An Efficient and Adaptive Granular-Ball Generation Method in Classification Problem",
  "abstract": "Granular-ball computing (GBC) is an efficient, robust, and scalable learning method for granular computing. The granular ball (GB) generation method is based on GB computing. This article proposes a method for accelerating GB generation using division to replace k -means. It can significantly improve the efficiency of GB generation while ensuring an accuracy similar to that of the existing methods. In addition, a new adaptive method for GB generation is proposed by considering the elimination of the GB overlap and other factors. This makes the GB generation process parameter-free and completely adaptive in the true sense. In addition, this study first provides mathematical models for the GB covering. The experimental results on some real datasets demonstrate that the two proposed GB generation methods have accuracies similar to those of the existing method in most cases, while adaptiveness or acceleration is realized. All the codes were released in the open-source GBC library at https://www.cquptshuyinxia.com/GBC.html or https://github.com/syxiaa/gbc.",
