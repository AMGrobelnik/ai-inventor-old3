  "title": "Influence-Based Community Partition With Sandwich Method for Social Networks",
  "abstract": "Community partition is an important problem in many areas, such as biology networks and social networks. The objective of this problem is to analyze the relationships among data via the network topology. In this article, we consider the community partition problem under the independent cascade (IC) model in social networks. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem that aims at partitioning a given social network into disjoint <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula> communities. The objective is to maximize the sum of influence propagation of a social network through maximizing it within each community. The existing work shows that the influence maximization for community partition problem (IMCPP) is NP-hard. We first prove that the objective function of IMCPP under the IC model is neither submodular nor supermodular. Then, both supermodular upper bound and submodular lower bound are constructed and proved so that the sandwich framework can be applied. A continuous greedy algorithm and a discrete implementation are devised for upper and lower bound problems. The algorithm for both of the two problems gets a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1-1/e$ </tex-math></inline-formula> approximation ratio. We also present a simple greedy algorithm to solve the original objective function and apply the sandwich approximation framework to it to guarantee a data-dependent approximation factor. Finally, our algorithms are evaluated on three real datasets, which clearly verifies the effectiveness of our method in the community partition problem, as well as the advantage of our method against the other methods.",
