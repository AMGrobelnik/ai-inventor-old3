  "title": "Formal Synthesis of Stochastic Systems via Control Barrier Certificates",
  "abstract": "This paper focuses on synthesizing control policies for discrete-time\\nstochastic control systems together with a lower bound on the probability that\\nthe systems satisfy the complex temporal properties. The desired properties of\\nthe system are expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications over\\nfinite traces. In particular, our approach decomposes the given specification\\ninto simpler reachability tasks based on its automata representation. We then\\npropose the use of so-called \\\\emph{control barrier certificate} to solve those\\nsimpler reachability tasks along with computing the corresponding controllers\\nand probability bounds. Finally, we combine those controllers to obtain a\\nhybrid control policy solving the considered problem. Under some assumptions,\\nwe also provide two systematic approaches for uncountable and finite input sets\\nto search for control barrier certificates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nthe proposed approach on a room temperature control and lane-keeping of a\\nvehicle modeled as a four-dimensional single-track kinematic model. We compare\\nour results with the discretization-based methods in the literature.\\n",
