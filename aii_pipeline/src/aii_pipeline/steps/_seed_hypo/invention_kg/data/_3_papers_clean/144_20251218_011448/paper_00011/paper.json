  "title": "State of the Art in Software Verification and Witness Validation: SV-COMP 2024",
  "abstract": "Abstract The 13th edition of the Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP 2024) was the largest competition of its kind so far: A total of 76 tools for verification and witness validation were compared. The competition evaluated 59 verification systems and 17 validation systems from 34 teams from 12 countries. This yields a good overview of the state of the art in tools for software verification. The competition was executed on a benchmark set with 30 300 verification tasks for C programs and 587 . verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications again included reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year was the second time that the competition had an extra competition track on witness validation. We introduced a new witness format 2.0, and a new scoring schema for the validation track. All meta data about the verification and validation tools are available in the FM-Tools repository.",
