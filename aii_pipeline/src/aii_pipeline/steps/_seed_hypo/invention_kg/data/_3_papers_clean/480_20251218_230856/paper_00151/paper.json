  "title": "Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Control: A Survey and Recent Advances",
  "abstract": "This article reviews the recent development of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with applications in control. First, its applications in optimal regulation are introduced, and some skilled and efficient algorithms are presented. Next, the use of ADP to solve game problems, mainly nonzero-sum game problems, is elaborated. It is followed by applications in large-scale systems. Note that although the functions presented in this article are based on continuous-time systems, various applications of ADP in discrete-time systems are also analyzed. Moreover, in each section, not only some existing techniques are discussed, but also possible directions for future work are pointed out. Finally, some overall prospects for the future are given, followed by conclusions of this article. Through a comprehensive and complete investigation of its applications in many existing fields, this article fully demonstrates that the ADP intelligent control method is promising in today's artificial intelligence era. Furthermore, it also plays a significant role in promoting economic and social development.",
