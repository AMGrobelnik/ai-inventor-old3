  "title": "Improvements in Software Verification and Witness Validation: SV-COMP 2025",
  "abstract": "Abstract The 14th edition of the Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP 2025) evaluated 62 verification tools and 18 witness validation tools, making it the largest comparison of its kind so far. Out of these, 35 verification and 13 validation tools participated with an active support of teams led by 33 different representatives from 12 countries. The verification track of the competition was executed on a benchmark set of 33 353 verification tasks with C programs and 6 different specifications (reachability, memory safety, memory cleanup, overflows, termination, and data races) and 674 verification tasks with Java programs checked for assertion validity. Additionally, we considered 673 verification tasks with Java programs checked for runtime exceptions as a demo category. The validation track analyzed the witnesses generated in the verification track and newly also 103 handcrafted witnesses. To handle the increasing complexity of the competition, the organization committee has been established.",
