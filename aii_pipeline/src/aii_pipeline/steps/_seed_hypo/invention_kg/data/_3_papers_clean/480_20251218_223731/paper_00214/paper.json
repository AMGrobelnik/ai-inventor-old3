  "title": "AdaBoost Ensemble Methods Using K-Fold Cross Validation for Survivability with the Early Detection of Heart Disease",
  "abstract": "As a result of technology improvements, various features have been collected for heart disease diagnosis. Large data sets have several drawbacks, including limited storage capacity and long access and processing times. For medical therapy, early diagnosis of heart problems is crucial. Disease of heart is a devastating human disease that is quickly increasing in developed and also developing countries, resulting in death. In this type of disease, the heart normally fails to provide enough blood to different body parts in order to allow them to perform their regular functions. Early, as well as, proper diagnosis of this condition is very critical for averting further damage and also to save patients’ lives. In this work, machine learning (ML) is utilized to find out whether a person has cardiac disease or not. Both the types of ensemble classifiers, namely, homogeneous as well as heterogeneous classifiers (formed by combining two separate classifiers), have been implemented in this work. The data mining preprocessing using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been employed to cope with the imbalance problem of the class as well as noise. The proposed work has two steps. SMOTE is used in the initial phase to reduce the impact of data imbalance and the second phase is classifying data using Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT) algorithms, and their ensembles. The experimental results demonstrate that the AdaBoost-Random Forest classifier provides 95.47% accuracy in the early detection of heart disease.",
