"""Artifact executors for invention loop.

Each executor handles one artifact type:
- research: OpenAI GPT-5-mini with web search
- experiment: Claude agent with code execution
- dataset: Claude agent with HuggingFace/web access
- evaluation: Claude agent with artifact access
- proof: DeepSeek Prover V2 via OpenRouter with Lean 4

Skills are auto-discovered from .claude/skills/ via setting_sources=["project"].

Uses AgentInitializer/AgentFinalizer from aii_lib for common patterns.
